        Chapter I -- The WeylGroup and WeylElt classes

  The Weyl group class is a variation on my favourite implementation in terms
  of transducers.

  I have tried to make a careful choice of datatype for the group elements in
  order to strike the right balance between efficiency and generality. This has
  led me to the choice of _fixed size_ arrays of unsigned chars, representing
  the "parabolic subquotient" representation of a given element; in other
  words, in a group of rank n, the first n elements of the array are used
  (but since it is fixed size, we have to allocate it to some constant value,
  namely RANK_MAX.) This is not so wasteful as it may sound : of course the
  representation as a single number is more compact, but will overflow even
  on 64-bit machines for some groups of rank <= 16, and much sooner of course
  on 32-bit machines; also it imposes some computational overhead for packing
  and unpacking. Any variable-size structure like the STL vector uses already
  three unsigned longs for its control structure (the address of the data, the
  size and the capacity), and then it still has to allocate. This could
  perhaps be simplified to just a pointer (after all the size of the
  allocation is known to the group) but you still have the big overhead of
  allocating and deallocating memory from the heap, and remembering to delete
  the pointers when they go out of scope, or else use autopointers ...

  And if worst comes to worst and one really is worried about a factor 2
  waste for type E8 (which might be significant if one deals with huge
  containers of group elements), then one can still recompile with MAX_RANK=8,
  which will then give a datatype that in 64 bits is the same size as an
  unsigned long.

  Notice that the unsigned char type miraculously suffices for all subquotients
  of all groups up to rank 128 (indeed, the biggest subquotient for B128 is
  of order 256), _provided_ the generators are enumerated in an appropriate
  order. This forces us to do quite a bit of type recognition, which is
  relegated to the dynkin namespace. Because of this reordering, the group
  carries a little interface that will translate back and forth from the
  external ordering and the internal one.

/*
  Amazingly, I could simplify Fokko's original to the code below.
  Fokko's original code was (more or less):

  Generator t = s;
  for (unsigned long j = d_rank; j-->0;) {
    if (d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t) == UndefGenerator) {
      // no transduction; shift and terminate
      unsigned long l = d_transducer[j].length(w[j]);
      w[j] = d_transducer[j].shift(w[j],t);
      if (d_transducer[j].length(w[j]) > l)
	return 1;
      else
	return -1;
    }
    else {
      // no shift; transduce and continue
      t = d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t);
    }
  }

  The main simplifications are to avoid calling |d_transducer[j].out| twice in
  succession, and to avoid calling |d_transducer[j].length| at all (since
  comparison of the |EltPiece| values suffices to decide sense of change).

  I left the test for |UndefGenerator| coming first, as transduce is more
  frequent than shift; hence the following even simpler code could be less
  efficient:

  Generator t=s;
  for (Generator j=d_rank; j-->0; t=d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t))
  {
    EltPiece wj=w[j]; w[j]=d_transducer[j].shift(wj,s);

/*!
  \brief Tells whether |w| twisted-commutes with |s|: $s.w.\delta(s)=w$

  Precondition: |w| is a twisted involution: $w^{-1}=\delta(w)$. Therefore
  twisted commutation is equivalent to $s.w$ being a twisted involution.

  This is in fact the case if and only if $s.w.\delta(s)$ has the same
  length as $w$, by the following reasoning. Suppose first that $s.w$ is
  reduced, then its twisted inverse $w.\delta(s)$ is reduced as well. Then
  the only possible reduction in $s.w.\delta(s)$ is cancellation of the
  extremal generators; whether this reduction applies is equivalent to having
  twisted commutation. If $s.w$ is not reduced, then neither is
  $w.\delta(s)$, and $w'=s.w.\delta(s)$ is a twisted involution not
  longer than $w$. If it is strictly shorter then obviously twisted
  commutation fails. In the remaining case that $l(s.w.\delta(s))=l(w)$,
  let $v=s.w$ so that $w=s.v$ and $w'=v.\delta(s)$ are reduced, but
  $w.\delta(s)=s.v.\delta(s)$ does reduce, which can only be by cancelling
  the extremal generators: $s.v.\delta(s)=v$ which implies $w'=w$, and one
  has twisted commutation.

}


/*!
  Precondition: tw is a twisted involution: $tw^{-1}=\delta(tw)$.

  The argument given under |hasTwistedCommutation| shows that for every
  generator |s| exactly one of $s.tw$ and $s.tw.\delta(s)$ is a twisted
  involution distinct from $tw$, and that if $l(s.tw)<l(tw)$ (for the usual
  length function on the Weyl group) then the length of this new twisted
  involution is less than that of $tw$ (by 1 or 2, respectively). A "reduced
  expression as a twisted involution" for $tw$ is obtained by iterating this
  to bring the length down to $0$. Working back from the identity (so reading
  our expression from right to left), it can be determined for each letter to
  which if the two types of transformation it corresponds; nevertheless, we
  encode which case prevails in the sign of the generator recorded: we
  bitwise-complement for the case of conjugation.

  Although not immediately obvious, all such reduced expressions do have the
  same length.

  The code below chooses the first possible generator (for the internal
  numbering, as returned by |leftDescent|) at each step, so the reduced
  expression found is lexicographically first for the internal renumbering.

\brief Constructs subquotient \#r for the Coxeter matrix c.

  This uses the Coxeter matrix only up to index r. In fact we can behave as
  if generator |r| is the final one, since we ignore any higher ones for now.

  Precondition : c is a _normalized_ Coxeter matrix (meaning that all
  the parabolic subquotients W_{r-1}\\W_r are small enough to fit in
  an unsigned char); and r is < rank(c);

  Algorithm :

  The algorithm is a version of my favorite bootstrapping procedure for the
  construction of Weyl groups and parabolic quotients. We start with a
  partially defined automaton containing only one element, and for which all
  shifts by the final generator $r$ are not yet defined (generators $i<r$ give
  transduction of $i$). At each point in time, all shifts for all elements in
  the automaton that do _not_ take the length up are defined; and we maintain
  a queue of elements that may have as yet undefined shifts.

  We start up with one element in the automaton, with just one undefined
  shift, the one by r. Then run through the elements $x$ of the automaton in
  order of generation (which will also be in ShortLex order), and for each as
  yet undefined shift of $x$ by $s$ :

    - add a new element $xs$ (this increases the size of the automaton, during
      the loop!). At this point it is sure that this element is really new,
      and that its normal form is obtained by adding $s$ to that of $x$

    - then find all other elements $x'$ already in the automaton and $t$ such
      that $xs==x't$ (so $x't$ gives a non-canonical but reduced expression
      for $xs$). Do this by trying generators $t\neq s$: if $xst$ goes down
      (has the same length as $x$) then $x'==xst$ gives such a case. The trick
      for this is to look at the orbit of x under the dihedral group $\<s,t>$.
      In the full group, this has necessarily cardinality 2m, with m = m(s,t)
      the coefficient in the Coxeter matrix, and $l(xst)==l(x)$ iff $xs$ is
      the unique elt. of maximal length in the orbit, hence to have this $x$
      must goes down $m-1$ times when applying successively $t$, $s$, $t$, ...
      In the parabolic quotient, the orbit of the dihedral group (which is not
      reduced to a point) can either have cardinality $2m$ or cardinality $m$,
      and in the latter case it is a string with $m-1$ steps between the
      bottom and the top, with a stationary step at either extreme (to see
      this, note that on one hand each step up in the full group gives a step
      in the quotient that is either up or stationary, while on the other hand
      a stationary step in the quotient causes then next step to be the
      reverse of the previous one). So we have one of the following three
      cases: (1) $x$ goes down $m-1$ times; then the image of the orbit has
      $2m$ elements and $xs==x't$ for $x'=x.(ts)^(m-1)$. (2) $x$ goes down
      $m-2$ times to some element $a$ and is then stationary (if
      $s'\in\{s,t\}$ is the next to apply, then $a.s'=g.a$ for some generator
      $g\in W_{r-1}$). In case (2) the orbit has $m$ elements, and if $v$ is
      the alternating word in $\{s,t\}$ of length $m-2$ not starting with
      $s'$, so that $a.v=x$, one has $v.st=s'vs$ whence
      $x.st=a.v.st=a.s'vs=g.a.vs=g.xs$ so that $xs$ has a transduction for $t$
      that outputs the generator $g$. (3) either $x$ goes down less than $m-2$
      times, or $m-2$ times followed by an upward step; then $xst$ goes up.
